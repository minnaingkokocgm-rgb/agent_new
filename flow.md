## 0. Unified Flow: Registration → Survey

### Flow (2026-06-05)

```
GET /s/{event}/register
  → Visitor fills registration form (name, email, company, job title, etc.)
  → AI Assistant helps with questions (RegistrationAssistantAgent)
  → Submit form via POST /api/registration/submit
    → Registration record updated (status=submitted)
    → Visitor record created from registration data
    → Registration.visitor_id linked to Visitor
    → Response includes visitor_id
  → Frontend redirects to: /s/{event}?visitor_id=X

GET /s/{event}?visitor_id=X
  → Survey chat loads with visitorId in context
  → POST /api/survey/start { event_id, booth_id, visitor_id }
    → StartSurveySession uses existing Visitor (not anonymous)
    → SurveyAgent::make($event, $booth, $visitor)  — only if $visitor->name is set
    → System prompt includes visitor name, company, job title
    → Agent skips identity questions, asks deeper questions
```

### Key Changes

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Registration → thank-you page (dead end) | Registration → survey page (seamless) |
| Survey creates anonymous Visitor | Survey reuses registered Visitor |
| Agent asks name/role/company (wasteful) | Agent knows visitor, asks deeper questions |
| Registration and survey are separate silos | Single visitor journey: register → survey |

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `app/Models/Visitor.php` | Added `company`, `job_title`, `country` fillable + `registrations()` relationship |
| `app/Models/Registration.php` | Added `visitor_id` fillable + `visitor()` relationship |
| `database/migrations/*_add_visitor_fields_*.php` | Added columns to visitors table |
| `database/migrations/*_add_visitor_id_to_registrations.php` | Added FK to registrations table |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Api/RegistrationController.php` | `submit()` creates Visitor, returns `visitor_id` |
| `app/Ai/Agents/SurveyAgent.php` | Constructor accepts `?Visitor`, `instructions()` injects visitor info |
| `app/Actions/StartSurveySession.php` | Accepts `?int $visitorId`, uses existing Visitor if provided |
| `app/Actions/ProcessAnswer.php` | Passes `$session->visitor` to SurveyAgent |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Api/SurveyController.php` | Passes `visitor_id` to StartSurveySession |
| `app/Http/Requests/StartSurveyRequest.php` | Validates optional `visitor_id` |
| `app/Http/Controllers/SurveyPageController.php` | Passes `visitorId` query param to view |
| `resources/views/survey/chat.blade.php` | Sends `visitor_id` in start API call |
| `resources/views/survey/register.blade.php` | Redirects to survey with `visitor_id` after submit |

### Visitor Info Injection

The SurveyAgent conditionally injects visitor details. If the Visitor has a `name`, it's appended to the system prompt. If the Visitor is anonymous (no name), no visitor info is added.

```php
// app/Ai/Agents/SurveyAgent.php — instructions()
if ($this->visitor?->name) {
    $visitorInfo = "\n\nVisitor: {$this->visitor->name}";
    if ($this->visitor->company || $this->visitor->job_title) {
        $parts = array_filter([$this->visitor->job_title, $this->visitor->company]);
        $visitorInfo .= ' ('.implode(' at ', $parts).')';
    }
    $visitorInfo .= '. They already registered — do NOT ask for name, company, or job title.';
} else {
    $visitorInfo = '';
}
```

The `StartSurveySession` and `ProcessAnswer` actions only pass the Visitor to SurveyAgent when it has a name:

```php
SurveyAgent::make($event, $booth, $visitor->name ? $visitor : null)
```

---

## 1. High-Level Flow

```
POST /api/survey/start
  → StartSurveySession::handle($event, $booth, $visitorId?)
    → Visitor looked up by $visitorId OR created (anonymous, UUID7 session_token)
    → VisitorSession created (event_id, booth_id, status=active)
    → SurveyAgent::make($event, $booth, $visitor)->forUser($visitor)
    → prompt("A visitor just arrived. Greet them warmly and ask one simple opening question.")
    → Returns greeting + opening question

POST /api/survey/{session}/answer  (× 3-4)
  → ProcessAnswer::handle($session, $answer)
    → Store SessionAnswer linked to current question
    → SurveyAgent::make($event, $booth, $visitor)->continueLastConversation($visitor)
    → prompt("The visitor said: '...'. Respond naturally...")
    → Returns next response or [SURVEY_COMPLETE]
```

---

## 2. System Prompt

Built in `app/Ai/Agents/SurveyAgent.php::instructions()`. Hardcoded template with DB values injected.

### Injected Data

| Data | Source DB Column | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `$this->event->name` | `events.name` | `"TechConf 2026"` |
| `$this->event->description` | `events.description` | `"Brief overview of the event..."` |
| `$this->booth->name` | `booths.name` | `"AI Demo Station"` (booth-scoped only) |
| `$this->booth->description` | `booths.description` | `"What the booth showcases"` (booth-scoped only) |
| Visitor info | `visitors.name`, `company`, `job_title` | `"Visitor: John Smith (Software Engineer at Acme Corp)"` — only when visitor has a name |

### Actual System Prompt (from code)

```
You are a friendly host at "{event.name}"{boothContext}.{visitorInfo}{boothInfo}

Event description: {event.description}

YOUR ROLE:
Have a natural, helpful conversation with the visitor. Greet them, learn what interests
them, answer their questions, and guide them. Be warm and concise — not pushy, not scripted.

HOW TO START:
- Greet the visitor warmly in 1-2 sentences. Ask ONE simple opening question (what brings
  them here, what caught their eye, what they're curious about).
- Do NOT dump a wall of event info. Keep the greeting light.

DURING THE CONVERSATION:
- When the visitor asks about the event, booths, products, schedule, or any event-related
  topic, use the EventKnowledgeSearch tool to find accurate information and answer helpfully.
- After answering, you may ask a natural follow-up question to learn more about their
  interests — but don't force it. If they just want info, that's fine.
- If relevant, mention other booths, sessions, or resources they might find useful.
- Keep responses brief (2-4 sentences). Don't monologue.

ENDING:
- After 3-4 exchanges, wrap up naturally. Thank them, offer a helpful pointer, and end
  with "[SURVEY_COMPLETE]".
- Don't drag the conversation on. If they seem done, let them go.

RULES:
- ONE question at a time, if you ask one. Don't stack questions.
- Always use the knowledge tool when answering event-related questions.
- Be responsive: if they ask a question, answer it before asking yours.
- If the visitor info is provided, never ask for name/company/job title.
- Do NOT rapid-fire questions. Do NOT give long monologues.
```

### Agent Configuration

```php
#[Model('openai/gpt-4o')]     // via OpenRouter
#[Temperature(0.7)]
#[MaxSteps(12)]                // max tool-calling loops per turn
#[MaxTokens(1024)]             // max response tokens
```

### Key Point

**Knowledge base chunks are NOT in the system prompt.** They are only available when the agent chooses to call `EventKnowledgeSearch`. The system prompt only contains basic event/booth identity from DB columns plus optional visitor info.

---

## 3. Conversation History

Managed by `RemembersConversations` trait + `RememberConversation` middleware (Laravel AI SDK).

### Turn 1 — Start

```
forUser($visitor)
  → conversation_id = null (new conversation)
  → prompt("A visitor just arrived. Greet them warmly...")

RememberConversation middleware:
  1. No existing conversation → creates one:
       conversation_id = UUID7
       title = generated from prompt (3-5 words)
  2. Stores user message: "A visitor just arrived..."
  3. Stores assistant response: greeting + opening question

Result: conversation persisted in agent_conversations + agent_conversation_messages
```

### Turn 2+ — Answer

```
continueLastConversation($visitor)
  → loads conversation_id from DB by visitor_id
  → messages() returns all previous messages from store (up to 100)
  → prompt("The visitor said: 'John, software engineer at Acme'. Respond naturally...")

LLM sees:
  [SYSTEM]  ← instructions()
  [USER]    ← "A visitor just arrived. Greet them warmly..."
  [ASSISTANT] ← "Hi! Welcome... What brings you here?"
  [USER]    ← "The visitor said: 'I'm interested in AI tools.' Respond naturally..."
  → Assistant responds

RememberConversation middleware:
  1. Conversation already exists → no new creation
  2. Stores user message
  3. Stores assistant response

Result: conversation grows by 2 messages per turn
```

### Storage Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agent_conversations` | Conversation metadata (id, participant_id, title) |
| `agent_conversation_messages` | Individual messages (conversation_id, role, content, tokens) |

### Participant Identity

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `forUser($visitor)` | Starts new conversation, keys to `visitor->id` |
| `continueLastConversation($visitor)` | Finds latest conversation for `visitor->id`, loads messages |

The `Visitor` model's `id` is used as the participant identifier. Each visitor gets their own conversation thread.

### Max Context Window

```php
protected function maxConversationMessages(): int
{
    return 100;  // last 100 messages included in context (default from RemembersConversations)
}
```

---

## 4. Knowledge Retrieval (EventKnowledgeSearch)

The agent calls this tool **only when it decides to** — it's not automatic. Triggered by instructions: "When the visitor asks about the event, booths, products, schedule, or any event-related topic, use the EventKnowledgeSearch tool".

### Search Flow

```
Agent decides to call: EventKnowledgeSearch(query="what products do you have")

1. Embed the query:
   Embeddings::for(["what products do you have"])
     ->dimensions(1536)
     ->generate(provider: 'openrouter', model: 'openai/text-embedding-3-small')

2. Vector search with scoping:
   KnowledgeChunk::query()
     ->where('event_id', $this->event->id)        // always scoped to event
     ->when($this->booth, fn($q) => $q->where(function ($q) {
         $q->where('booth_id', $this->booth->id)  // booth-specific chunks
           ->orWhereNull('booth_id');             // PLUS event-wide chunks
     }))
     ->whereVectorSimilarTo('embedding', $queryEmbedding, 0.6)  // similarity ≥ 0.6
     ->limit(5)
     ->get()

3. Return results as concatenated text:
   "Relevant event information found:

   This is booth A which showcases AI and machine learning demos...

   ---

   We have a chatbot demo, NLP pipeline, and computer vision showcase..."
```

### Scoping Behavior

```
Without booth (event-level survey):
  WHERE event_id = X
  → Searches ALL chunks for this event (event-wide + all booths)

With booth (booth-scoped survey):
  WHERE event_id = X AND (booth_id = Y OR booth_id IS NULL)
  → Searches booth-specific chunks AND event-wide chunks
```

### ✅ Fixed (2026-06-05)

Event-wide chunks (`booth_id=NULL`) were previously excluded from booth-scoped search.
Now the query includes `OR booth_id IS NULL`, so both booth-specific and event-wide chunks are returned.

---

## 5. Completion Logic

In `ProcessAnswer::handle()` — after **4 exchanges** (4 questions asked):

```php
$questionCount = $session->questions()->count();

if ($questionCount >= 4) {
    // Force complete — mark session done, send final prompt
    $session->update([
        'status' => 'completed',
        'completed_at' => now(),
    ]);

    $agent = SurveyAgent::make($session->event, $session->booth,
        $session->visitor->name ? $session->visitor : null
    )->continueLastConversation($session->visitor);

    $response = $agent->prompt(
        "The visitor said: \"{$answer}\". " .
        "Wrap up the conversation warmly, offer a helpful pointer, " .
        "and end with [SURVEY_COMPLETE]."
    );
}
```

The `[SURVEY_COMPLETE]` marker is detected by the frontend to show the thank-you state.

**Before the limit**, each answer triggers a natural continuation:

```php
$agent = SurveyAgent::make($session->event, $session->booth,
    $session->visitor->name ? $session->visitor : null
)->continueLastConversation($session->visitor);

$response = $agent->prompt(
    "The visitor said: \"{$answer}\". Respond naturally — answer any questions " .
    "using the knowledge tool if needed, then continue the conversation."
);
```

## 8. Current Limitations

1. **Hardcoded 4-exchange limit** — Not configurable per event. Always completes after `$questionCount >= 4`.
2. **No knowledge caching** — Every `EventKnowledgeSearch` call re-embeds and re-searches, even for repeated queries.
3. **Anonymous visitors** — `Visitor` record created with only a `session_token` (no name/email until registration or survey captures it).
4. **Frontend counter says "5"** — `chat.blade.php` shows "Question X of 5" but backend completes at 4 exchanges. This is a UX inconsistency.
5. **Chat UI code duplication** — Survey chat (`chat.blade.php`) and registration chat (`register.blade.php` chat panel) use similar but separate code for chat bubbles, typing indicators, and AJAX handling.
6. **No idle timeout** — Survey sessions have no auto-expiry or idle disconnect UI.
